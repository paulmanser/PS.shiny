<P>This window is used to produce plots of sample size vs. alternative hypotheses or sample size vs. power for studies with dichotomous outcomes.  The alternative hypotheses may be expressed as odds ratios, relative risks or the event rate in the case (experimental) group.  The form of the alternative hypotheses is determined in the main <I>PS</I> window.  The variable that is not chosen for the <I>x </I>axis is held constant for each sample size curve.  You may plot multiple curves on the same graph with different values of this third variable.</P>
