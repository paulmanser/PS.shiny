<P>
This window is used to produce plots of power vs. alternative hypotheses or power vs. sample size for Mantel-Haenszel Tests. The alternative hypotheses may be expressed as an (adjusted) odds ratio. The variable that is not chosen for the x-axis is held constant for each sample size curve. You may plot multiple curves on the same graph with different values of this third variable.
