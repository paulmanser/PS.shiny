<P>This window is used to produce plots of sample size vs. alternative hypotheses or sample size vs. power for studies of continuous response measures that may be analyzed with t-tests.  The alternative hypothesis is expressed as a true difference in population means.   The variable that is not chosen for the <I>x </I>axis is held constant for each sample size curve.  You may plot multiple curves on the same graph with different values of this third variable.</P>
