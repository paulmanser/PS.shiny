<P>This window is used to produce plots of sample size vs. alternative hypotheses or power vs. alternative hypotheses for studies that use simple linear regression.  The alternative hypothesis may be expressed as the slope of a simple linear regression curve.  The variable that is not chosen for the <I>y </I>axis is held constant for each curve.  You may plot multiple curves on the same graph with different values of this third variable.</P>
