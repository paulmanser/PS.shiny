<P>The Output section is where the user selects the result to be generated by the PS program.  In the Output field select one of the following (to make a selection, click in the Output box then click the desired output).</P>

<P><B>Sample size</B></P>

<P>For independent t-tests this is the number of experimental patients that must be studied to detect a true difference in population means &delta; with Type I error probability &alpha; given a standard deviation &sigma; and <I>m</I> controls per experimental patient.  For paired t-tests it is the number of pairs of patients needed to detect a true difference in population means &delta; with Type I error probability &alpha; given a standard deviation &sigma;.  </P>

<P>For independent studies it is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis with Type I error probability &alpha; given the specified sample size, a standard deviation &sigma; and a control/experimental patient ratio <I>m</I> when the true difference in population means is &delta;.  For paired studies it is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis with Type I error probability &alpha; given the specified sample size, a standard deviation &sigma; when the true difference in population means is &delta;.  </P>

<P><B>Detectable alternative</B></P>

<P>A difference in population means that can be detected with the specified power and Type I error probability &alpha; given a standard deviation &sigma;, and the specified sample size. </P>
