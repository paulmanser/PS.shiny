<P>This window is used to produce plots of sample size vs. alternative hypotheses or sample size vs. power for survival studies.  The alternative hypotheses may be expressed either as median experimental survival times or as relative risks (this choice is determined in the Design section of the main PS window).  The variable that is not chosen for the <I>x </I>axis is held constant for each sample size curve.  You may plot multiple curves on the same graph with different values of this third variable.</P>
