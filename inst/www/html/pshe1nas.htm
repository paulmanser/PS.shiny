<P><I>PS</I> graphics show the relationship between sample size, power and detectable alternative hypotheses.  Each graph is a plot of one of these variables against another.  The third variable is held constant at a value that you set in the field on the right.  You may plot several curves on one graph with different values of this variable.  Plot one graph first.  Then change the value of this variable and press the Plot button again.</P>
