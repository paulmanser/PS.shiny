<P><B><I>n </I></B><br>For case-control studies <i>n</i> is the number of case patients.&nbsp; For prospective studies <i>n</i> is the number of patients receiving the

<P><b><i>p</i><sub>0 </sub></b><br>For case-control studies, <i>p</i><sub>0</sub>
is the probability of exposure in controls.  In prospective studies, <i>p</i><sub>0</sub>
is the probability of the outcome for a control patient.</P>

<P><B><i>p</i><sub>1 </sub></B><br>For case-control studies, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> is the probability of exposure in cases.  In prospective studies,
<i>p</i><sub>1</sub> is the probability of the outcome in an experimental
subject.</P>

<P><B><I>m</I></B> <br>For independent prospective studies <i>m</i> is the ratio of control to experimental subjects.&nbsp;
For matched prospective studies <i>m</i> is the number of controls subjects matched to each experimental
	subject.  For independent case-control studies&nbsp; <i>m</i> is the ratio of control to case patients.&nbsp;
For matched case-control studies <i>m</i> is the number of control patients matched to each case.</P>

<P><B><I>R </I></B><br>Relative risk of failure for experimental subjects relative to controls.</P>

<P><b><font face="Symbol">f</font> </b><br>For case-control studies
<font face="Symbol">f</font> is the correlation coefficient for exposure
between matched cases and controls.&nbsp; For prospective studies
<font face="Symbol">f</font> is the correlation coefficient for the outcome
between matched experimental and control subjects.</P>

<P><B>&psi; </B><br>Odds ratio of exposure in cases relative to controls.
For a matched study design &psi; is the odds ratio adjusted for the matching variable(s).
For an independent design it is the unadjusted odds ratio.
If the cases and
controls are unbiased samples from respective target populations then &psi; also
equals the odds ratio for disease in exposed subjects relative to unexposed
subjects.&nbsp; The odds ratio approximates the relative risk in case-control studies when the disease is rare in the general population.</P>
