<P><B>Matched or Independent?</B></P>
<P>For Case-Control studies</P>
<blockquote>
	<P>Choose <I>Matched<B> </B>or<B> </B>Paired </I>if cases and controls are
	matched in such a way that exposure in cases may be correlated with exposure
	in controls.</P>
	<P>Choose <I>Independent</I> if exposure in cases and controls is uncorrelated.
	</P>
</blockquote>
<P>For Prospective Studies</P>
<blockquote>
	<P>Choose <i>Matched or Paired</i> if patients receiving the experimental or
	control treatments are matched or paired in such a way that the outcome in experimental
	subjects may be correlated with the outcome in matched controls.  In these studies
	the alternative hypothesis must be expressed as an odds ratio.</P>
	<P>Choose <i>Independent</i> if the outcomes of cases and controls are
	uncorrelated.</P>
</blockquote>
<P>N.B. In a case-control study we determine past exposure in cases who have
disease and controls who do not.&nbsp; In prospective studies we determine
outcomes in experimental subjects who are exposed and control subjects who are
not.</P>

<P><B>Case control?</B></P>

<P>Select<B> </B><I>Case-Control</I> for studies in which the outcome variable denotes exposure in cases with disease and controls without disease.</P>

<P>Select<B> </B><I>Prospective</I> for studies in which the outcome variable denotes events in subjects receiving different treatments.</P>

<P><B>How is the alternative hypothesis expressed?</B></P>

<P>Select one of the following to specify how the alternative hypothesis is expressed.  The choices you are given vary depending on your previous selections.</P>

<P><I>Two proportions</I></P>

<P><i>Odds ratio</i></P>

<P><I>Relative risk </I></P>

<P><I>Failure rates</I></P>

<P>The <I>odds ratio</I> approximates the relative risk in case-control studies when the disease is rare in the general population.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="dichot_chi_or_fishers"></A>Uncorrected Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact-test?</B></P>

<P>Select<B> </B><I>Uncorrected Chi-square test</I> if data will be analyzed with an uncorrected chi-squared test.</P>

<P>Select <I>Fisher’s Exact-test</I> if data will be analyzed with Fisher's exact-test or with a continuity corrected chi-squared test.</P>
