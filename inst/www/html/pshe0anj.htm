<P>This window is used to produce plots of power vs. alternative hypotheses or sample size vs. alternative hypotheses for studies with dichotomous outcomes.  The alternative hypothesis may be expressed as odds ratio, relative risk or the event rate in the case (experimental) group.  The form of the alternative hypotheses is determined in the main <I>PS</I> window.  The variable that is not chosen for the <I>y </I>axis is held constant for each sample size curve.  You may plot multiple curves on the same graph with different values of this third variable.</P>
