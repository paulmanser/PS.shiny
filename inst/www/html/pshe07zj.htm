<P>This window is used to produce plots of power vs. alternative hypotheses or power vs. sample size for studies with dichotomous outcomes.  The alternative hypotheses may be expressed as odds ratios, relative risks or failure rates in the case
or experimental group.  The form of the alternative hypotheses is determined in the main <I>PS</I> window.  The variable that is not chosen for the <I>x </I>axis is held constant for each sample size curve.  You may plot multiple curves on the same graph with different values of this third variable.</P>
