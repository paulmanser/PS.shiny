	<P>Choose <I>Matched<B> </B>or<B> </B>Paired </I>if cases and controls are
	matched in such a way that exposure in cases may be correlated with exposure
	in controls.</P>
	<P>Choose <I>Independent</I> if exposure in cases and controls is uncorrelated.

</blockquote>
<P>For Prospective Studies</P>
<blockquote>
	<P>Choose <i>Matched or Paired</i> if patients receiving the experimental or
	control treatments are matched or paired in such a way that the outcome in experimental
	subjects may be correlated with the outcome in matched controls.  In these studies
	the alternative hypothesis must be expressed as an odds ratio.</P>
	<P>Choose <i>Independent</i> if the outcomes of cases and controls are
	uncorrelated.</P>
</blockquote>
<P>N.B. In a case-control study we determine past exposure in cases who have
disease and controls who do not.  In prospective studies we determine
outcomes in experimental subjects who are exposed and control subjects who are
not.</P>
