<P>This window is used to produce plots of power vs. alternative hypotheses or sample size vs. alternative hypothesis for studies that compare two simple linear regressions.  The alternative hypotheses may be expressed as the difference in slops of two independent simple linear regression curves, or the difference in <I>y</I>-intercepts of these curves.  The variable that is not chosen for the <I>y </I>axis is held constant for each curve.  You may plot multiple curves on the same graph with different values of this third variable.</P>
