Description: PS is an interactive program for performing power and sample size
 calculations that may be downloaded for free. It can be used for studies
 with dichotomous, continuous, or survival response measures. The
 alternative hypothesis of interest may be specified either in terms
 of differing response rates, means, or survival times, or in terms of
 relative risks or odds ratios. Studies with dichotomous or continuous
 outcomes may involve either a matched or independent study design. The
 program can determine the sample size needed to detect a specified
 alternative hypothesis with the required power, the power with which a
 specific alternative hypothesis can be detected with a given sample size,
 or the specific alternative hypotheses that can be detected with a given
 power and sample size.
 The PS program can produce graphs to explore the relationships
 between power, sample size and detectable alternative
 hypotheses. It is often helpful to hold one of these variables
 constant and plot the other two against each other. The program
 can generate graphs of sample size versus power for a specific
 alternative hypothesis, sample size versus detectable alternative
 hypotheses for a specified power, or power versus detectable
 alternative hypotheses for a specified sample size. Linear or
 logarithmic axes may be used for either axes. Multiple curves
 can be plotted on a single graphic
